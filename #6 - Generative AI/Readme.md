## Edition 6 - Generative AI

➡️ For the sixth edition of the Hi! PARIS Reading groups, we teach you the Generative AI.

Generative models are now a powerful tool for many applications in Artificial Intelligence such as Natural Language Processing (Chat GPT, Google Bard) or image and video generation.  Of course, these applications entail ethical and societal applications. The objective of this reading group is to provide a general overview of the generative models used for these two popular applications on one hand, and to discuss the challenges involved by their developement on the other hand.

The edition consists on 3 sessions.
The reading group will present the Large Language Models(LLM) and their applications alongwith ethical and legal challenges involving their development.
