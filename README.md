# Hi! PARIS Reading groups ðŸ“š

The Hi! PARIS reading groups propose to study a topic using scientific articles on a theoretical and a practical point of view. The reading groups are opportunities of interaction between our corporate donors and our affiliates academic teams around selected topics of interest.

Each Edition is planned for 2-4 sessions presenting one topic by the mean of 3-4 research papers. For each session: presentation of mathematical models and theoretical advances by a researcher + simulations with a Python notebook by an engineer
