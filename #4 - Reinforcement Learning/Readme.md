## Edition 4 - Reinforcement Learning

➡️ For the 4th edition of the Hi! PARIS Reading groups, we teach you the Reinforcement Learning.

The edition consists on 2 sessions.
The reading group will introduce the Reinforcement Learning alongwith its applications.

### Session 1/2 – Reinforcement learning setting with a focus on policy learning
Tuesday 14 February, 2023 – 2.00-3.30pm (Online)


**📣 Speakers**

* Charlotte Laclau, Telecom Paris – IP Paris  


**📚 Program**

During this reading group, We will start with a brief introduction to the reinforcement learning setting with a focus on policy learning. We will then present GCPN (Graph Convolutional Policy Network), an approach that combines graph representation learning with reinforcement learning to generate realistic (novel) molecule graphs with desired chemical properties. The session will end with a practical application of this approach on two use cases.
